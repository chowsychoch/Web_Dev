<!-- Create a Web page that contains a list of 5-10 books. 
Each book should have fields for title, author, publisher and a short summary. 
Each of these fields should be formatted differently, using a CSS class. 
All books should share the same format for each field (i.e. the title field for all books should be formatted the same). 
Create an external style sheet called e3a.css to control this. 
Save the book page as e3a.html in the practical2 folder. -->
